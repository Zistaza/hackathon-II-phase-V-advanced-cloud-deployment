# Phase IV – Local Kubernetes Deployment of Todo AI Chatbot - Specification

## User Input

```
Phase IV – Local Kubernetes Deployment of Todo AI Chatbot

Target audience:
Hackathon evaluators and reviewers assessing cloud-native deployment,
AI-assisted DevOps practices, and spec-driven engineering maturity.

Focus:
Deploying the existing Phase III Todo AI Chatbot onto a local Kubernetes
cluster using Minikube, Helm Charts, and AI-assisted DevOps tools
(Docker AI Agent / Gordon, kubectl-ai, and Kagent).

The focus is on infrastructure, automation, reproducibility,
and correct use of AI agents — not on application feature expansion.

---

Success criteria:

- Frontend and backend applications are containerized as separate Docker images
- Docker AI Agent (Gordon) is used for Dockerfile generation or optimization
- Images build successfully using Docker Desktop
- Kubernetes deployment runs locally on Minikube
- Helm charts are created and used for application deployment
- kubectl-ai is demonstrated for:
  - Deployment
  - Scaling
  - Debugging or inspection
- Kagent is demonstrated for:
  - Cluster health analysis
  - Resource optimization insights
- No application-level logic or API changes are introduced
- Entire workflow follows:
  Spec → Plan → Tasks → AI-assisted Execution
- Deployment is reproducible and demo-ready

---

Constraints:

- Environment: Local machine only (Minikube)
- Container runtime: Docker Desktop
- Kubernetes orchestration: Minikube
- Package management: Helm Charts
- AI DevOps tools:
  - Docker AI Agent (Gordon)
  - kubectl-ai
  - Kagent
- Application code from Phase III is LOCKED
- No cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- No production clusters
- No manual Dockerfile or YAML authoring unless generated by AI agents
- All commands must be copy-paste reproducible

---

Timeline:

- Phase IV completion within hackathon timeline
- Deployment must be demonstrable in a single local session

---

Not building:

- New application features
- UI or UX enhancements
- Authentication or database changes
- Cloud-hosted Kubernetes clusters
- Advanced observability stacks (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.)
- CI/CD pipelines
- Production hardening beyond local deployment needs
- Vendor or tool comparisons

---

Deliverables:

- Phase IV constitution (infrastructure-focused)
- Phase IV specification, plan, and task documents
- Docker images for frontend and backend
- Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment
- Demonstrated usage of:
  - docker ai
  - kubectl-ai
  - kagent
- Running Todo AI Chatbot on Minikube
```

## Response Summary

Successfully created the specification for Phase IV - Local Kubernetes Deployment of Todo AI Chatbot. The specification includes:

- Three prioritized user stories covering containerization (P1), Kubernetes deployment (P2), and AI DevOps tool demonstration (P3)
- Comprehensive functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-008) detailing all necessary capabilities
- Key entities including Container Images, Helm Chart, and Minikube Cluster
- Six measurable success criteria (SC-001 to SC-006) with specific, quantifiable outcomes
- Identified edge cases for resource limitations, image pull failures, and deployment failures

The specification adheres to all constraints including using Docker AI Agent (Gordon) for containerization, Helm Charts for deployment, and demonstrating kubectl-ai and Kagent capabilities. The application code from Phase III remains unchanged as required.

## Outcome

Specification is complete and ready for the planning phase. The feature is well-defined with clear success criteria and testable requirements that align with the hackathon objectives for demonstrating AI-assisted DevOps practices and cloud-native deployment.
