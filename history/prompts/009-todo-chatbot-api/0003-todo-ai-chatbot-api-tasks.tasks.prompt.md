## Prompt


## Response snapshot

Successfully created a comprehensive tasks breakdown for the Todo AI Chatbot API implementation with 6 phases: Setup, Foundational, and 3 User Stories plus Polish phase. Tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete task breakdown with 68 specific, actionable tasks organized by user story priority
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: specs/009-todo-chatbot-api/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement to begin executing the tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks are organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing, with proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All tasks follow required checklist format with checkboxes, IDs, story labels where appropriate, and file paths
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard tasks creation prompt (empty input)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation of Phase 1 setup tasks
