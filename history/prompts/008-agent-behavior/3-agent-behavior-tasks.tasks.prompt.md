response_text: "Created comprehensive task breakdown for Todo AI Chatbot Agent Behavior implementation. Organized tasks into 6 phases: Setup, Foundational Components, and 3 User Stories (Correct Tool Selection P1, Multi-Step Reasoning P2, Error & Confirmation Handling P3), plus polish phase. Tasks follow proper checklist format with sequential IDs, story labels, and file paths. Dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified. All acceptance criteria from user stories mapped to specific tasks."
outcome: "Complete task breakdown created with 76 specific implementation tasks organized by user story priority"
evaluation: "Tasks are well-organized by user story priority, follow proper checklist format, include all necessary components from the spec and plan, and maintain independence between user stories while ensuring foundational components are completed first."
