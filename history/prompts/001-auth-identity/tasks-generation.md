# Prompt History Record: Authentication & Identity Tasks Generation

## Original Prompt
```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Summary
Generated comprehensive tasks.md file for the authentication and identity feature based on the spec, plan, data model, contracts, research, and quickstart documents. The tasks are organized by user stories in priority order, follow the required checklist format, and include all necessary implementation steps for a secure authentication system using Better Auth and JWT.
