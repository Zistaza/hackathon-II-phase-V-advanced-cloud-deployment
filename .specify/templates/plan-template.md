# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Event-Driven Architecture Compliance
- [ ] All state changes emit events to appropriate Kafka topics (task-events, reminders, task-updates)
- [ ] Event schemas include: event_id, event_type, user_id, timestamp, payload
- [ ] No direct service-to-service API calls (use events or Dapr Service Invocation)

### Dapr Integration Compliance
- [ ] Pub/Sub component configured for Kafka/Redpanda
- [ ] State Management component configured for Postgres/Neon DB
- [ ] Jobs API configured for reminder scheduling
- [ ] Secrets Management configured (no hardcoded secrets)
- [ ] Service Invocation configured with mTLS

### Security & Multi-Tenancy Compliance
- [ ] All endpoints require JWT authentication
- [ ] All database queries filtered by authenticated user_id
- [ ] All event handlers validate user ownership
- [ ] Service-to-service communication authenticated (JWT/API keys/RBAC)

### Advanced Features Compliance
- [ ] Recurring tasks: task.completed events trigger next instance creation
- [ ] Due dates & reminders: Dapr Jobs API schedules reminder triggers
- [ ] Priorities, tags, search, filter, sort: indexed queries only

### Deployment & Observability Compliance
- [ ] Works on Minikube (local) before cloud deployment
- [ ] Helm charts with parameterized values.yaml
- [ ] Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards configured
- [ ] Centralized logging (Loki/OpenSearch) configured
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline automated (GitHub Actions)

### Validation & Error Prevention Compliance
- [ ] All event handlers are idempotent (use event_id for deduplication)
- [ ] Schema validation at event publish and consume
- [ ] Strict type checking with Pydantic models
- [ ] Exception handling with retry logic and dead-letter queues

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
