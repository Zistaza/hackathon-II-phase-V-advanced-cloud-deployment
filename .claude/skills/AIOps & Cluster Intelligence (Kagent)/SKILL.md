# AIOps & Cluster Intelligence with Kagent

## Instructions

1. **Cluster Health Analysis**
   - Evaluate node and pod health
   - Detect unhealthy workloads
   - Identify stability risks

2. **Resource Optimization**
   - Analyze CPU and memory usage
   - Suggest better resource requests and limits
   - Detect over-provisioning or under-provisioning

3. **Operational Insights**
   - Recommend scaling strategies
   - Highlight configuration improvements
   - Suggest cost-efficient adjustments (even locally)

4. **AI-Driven Reporting**
   - Explain findings in clear language
   - Provide actionable recommendations
   - Avoid unnecessary complexity

## Best Practices
- Run analysis after deployments
- Compare before/after optimization states
- Focus on clarity over volume of metrics
- Apply recommendations incrementally
- Use Kagent as a decision-support tool

## Example Commands
```bash
kagent "analyze the cluster health"
kagent "optimize resource allocation"
kagent "identify performance risks in the cluster"
